About the Course üìö
================

‚úÖ Why Java 8 ?
----------------

‚Ä¢ Most popular and widely accepted language in the world.

‚Ä¢ Java creators wanted to introduce the Functional features such as:

     ‚Ä¢ Lambdas

     ‚Ä¢ Streams

     ‚Ä¢ Optional and etc.,

‚Ä¢ Technological advancements with the mobile/laptops/systems.

‚Ä¢ New Java 8 features simplify the concurrency operations.

‚úÖFunctional Programming: ‚ùì
-------------------------
‚Ä¢ Embraces creating Immutable objects.

‚Ä¢ More concise and readable code.

‚Ä¢ Using functions/methods as first class citizens.

Example:

     Function<String,String> addSomeString = (name) -> name.toUpperCase().concat("default");

‚Ä¢ Write code using Declarative approach.

 ‚úÖImperative vs Declarative Programming
  =====================================

üëâImperative Style of Programming
-------------------------------

‚Ä¢ Focuses on how to perform the operations.

‚Ä¢ Embraces Object mutability.

‚Ä¢ This style of programming lists the step by step of instructions on how to achieve an objective.

‚Ä¢ We write the code on what needs to be done in each step.

‚Ä¢ Imperative style is used with classic Object Oriented Programming.

üëâDeclarative Style of Programming
--------------------------------

‚Ä¢ Focuses on what is the result you want.

‚Ä¢ Embraces Object immutability.

‚Ä¢ Analogous to SQL (Structured Query Languague).

‚Ä¢ Use the functions that are already part of the library to achieve an objective.

‚Ä¢ Functional Programming uses the concept of declarative programming.

‚û°Ô∏èImperative vs Declarative Programming
--------------------------------------

                                 Example 1
                     Sum of 100 numbers from 0 to 100

                      /* Imperative Style of Programming - How style of programming */
                       int sum = 0;
                       for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
                       sum += i;
                       }
                       System.out.println("Imperative Style of Programming : " + sum); // 5050

                       /* Declarative Style of Programming - What style of programming */
                       int sum1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(0, 100)
                       .sum();
                       System.out.println("Declarative Style of Programming : " + sum1); //5050

What is Lambda Expression‚ùì
-------------------------

‚Ä¢ Lambda is equivalent to a function (method) without a name.

‚Ä¢ Lambda‚Äôs are also referred as Anonymous functions.

          ‚Ä¢ Method parameters
          ‚Ä¢ Method Body
          ‚Ä¢ Return Type
‚Ä¢ Lambdas are not tied to any class like a regular method.

‚Ä¢ Lambda can also be assigned to variable and passed around.

‚û°Ô∏èSyntax of the Lambda Expression
-------------------------------

  Lambda Expression: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35c21dff-6ece-40f8-87e7-592c9847bc0a)

 ‚úÖUsages of Lambda
 ------------------

 ‚Ä¢ Lambda is mainly used to implement Functional Interfaces(SAM).
 
               @FunctionalInterface
               public interface Comparator<T> {
                int compare(T o1, T o2);
               }
               @FunctionalInterface
               public interface Runnable {
                public abstract void run();
               }

‚úÖLambda in Practice ( Things to keep in Mind)
-------------------------------------------

( ) -> Single Statement or Expression; // curly braces are not needed.

( )-> { <Multiple Statements> }; // curly braces are needed for multiple statements.

‚û°Ô∏èLambdas vs Legacy Java(until Java7)
-----------------------------------

Legacy:

     Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
      @Override
      public void run() {
      System.out.println("Inside Runnable 1");
      }
     };

Java 8:

     Runnable runnableLambda = () -> {System.out.println("Inside Runnable
     2");};     

‚úÖFunctional Interfaces
------------------------

‚Ä¢ Exists since Java 1.0 

Definition:

‚Ä¢ A Functional Interface(SAM) is an interface that has exactly one abstract
method. 

@FunctionalInterface:

‚Ä¢ This annotation is introduced as part of the JDK 1.8.

‚Ä¢ Optional annotation to signify an interface as Functional Interface.

‚úÖNew Functional Interfaces in Java8
------------------------------------

     ‚Ä¢ Consumer
     ‚Ä¢ Predicate
     ‚Ä¢ Function
     ‚Ä¢ Supplier
     ‚Ä¢ Consumer ‚Äì BiConsumer
     ‚Ä¢ Predicate - BiPredicate
     ‚Ä¢ Function ‚Äì BiFunction, UnaryOperator, BinaryOperator
     ‚Ä¢ Consumer ‚Äì IntConsumer, DoubleConsumer, LongConsumer
     ‚Ä¢ Predicate ‚Äì IntPredicate, BiPredicate, LongPredicate
     ‚Ä¢ Function ‚Äì IntFunction, DoubleFunction, LongFunction,IntToDoubleFunction,
                  IntoLongFunction,DoubletoIntFunction,
                  DoubletoLongFunction,LongtoIntFunction,
                  LongtoDoubleFunction,ToIntFunction,
                  ToDoubleFunction,ToLongFunction
     ‚Ä¢ Supplier ‚Äì IntSupplier, LongSupplier, DoubleSupplier, BooleanSupplier
     
‚úÖMethod Reference
--------------------

‚Ä¢ Introduced as part of Java 8 and its purpose is to simplify the implementation Functional Interfaces.

‚Ä¢ Shortcut for writing the Lambda Expressions.

‚Ä¢ Refer a method in a class.

‚û°Ô∏èSyntax of Method Reference
-----------------------------

      ClassName::instance-methodName
      ClassName::static-methodName
      Instance::methodName

 Where to use Method Reference ‚ùì
 -------------------------------

 ‚Ä¢ Lambda expressions referring to a method directly.
   
   Using Lambda: 
   
       Function<String,String> toUpperCaseLambda = (s)->s.toUpperCase(); 

   Using Method Reference:

      Function<String,String> toUpperCaseMethodRefernce = String::toUpperCase;
    
 Where Method Reference is not Applicable ‚ùì 
 ------------------------------------------

 Example: 

     Predicate<Student> predicateUsingLambda = (s) -> s.getGradeLevel()>=3;

‚úÖConstructor Reference  
-----------------------

‚Ä¢ Introduced as part of Java 1.8

Syntax:

    Classname::new

Example: 

    Supplier<Student> studentSupplier = Student::new; 

Invalid: 

    Student student = Student::new; // compilation issue

‚û°Ô∏èLambdas and Local Variables
------------------------------

What is a Local variable ‚ùì

‚Ä¢ Any variable that is declared inside a method is called a local variable. 

‚Ä¢ Lambdas have some restrictions on using local variables üëâ 

        ‚Ä¢ Not allowed to use the same the local variable name as lambda parameters or inside the lambda body.
        
        ‚Ä¢ Not allowed re-assign a value to a local variable.

‚Ä¢ No restrictions on instance variables.

Local Variables ‚Äì Not Allowed
----------------------------

   ‚û°Ô∏èRepeated Variable Name :

‚Ä¢ Variable i is declared in the same scope and used as a parameter in Lambda.

‚Ä¢ You cannot use the same variable as a lambda parameter or inside the lambda body.

   Same Variable as Input üëâ :

        int i=0; //Repeated varibale name not allowed
        Consumer<Integer> c1 = (i) -> {
        System.out.println(i+value);
        };

  Same Variable as Lambda parameter üëâ :

       int i=0;
       Consumer<Integer> c1 = (i) -> { //Repeated variable name not allowed
       System.out.println(i+value); 
       };
    
  Same Variable in Lambda Body üëâ :

      int i=0;
      Consumer<Integer> c1 = (a) -> {
      int i=0; //Repeated variable name not allowed
      System.out.println(i+value);
      };
‚Ä¢ Not allowed to modify the value inside the lamda

     int value =4;
     Consumer<Integer> c1 = (a) -> {
         value=6; //reassigning not allowed
         System.out.println(i+value);
     };

‚úÖ Effectively Final   
---------------------

‚Ä¢ Lambda‚Äôs are allowed to use local variables but not allowed to modify it even though they are not declared final. This concept is called 

  Effectively Final.

‚Ä¢ Not allowed to modify the value inside the lamda

         int value =4; Consumer<Integer> c1 = (a) -> {
         value=6; //reassigning not allowed 
         System.out.println(i+value);
         };
         
‚Ä¢ Prior to Java 8 , any variable that‚Äôs used inside the anonymous class should be declared final.  

Advantages of Effectively Final :
---------------------------------

‚Ä¢ Easy to perform concurrency operations.

‚Ä¢ Promotes Functional Programming and demotes the Imperative style programming.

‚úÖ Introduction to Streams API:
-------------------------------

‚Ä¢ Introduced as part of Java8.

‚Ä¢ Main purpose is to perform some Operation on Collections.

‚Ä¢ Parallel operations are easy to perform with Streams API without having to spawn a multiple threads.

‚Ä¢ Streams API can be also used with arrays or any kind of I/O.

What is a Stream ‚ùì
-------------------

‚Ä¢ Stream is a sequence of elements which can be created out of a collections such as List or Arrays or any kind of I/O resources and etc., 

     List<String> names = Arrays.asList("adam","dan","jenny");
     names.stream(); // creates a stream

 ‚Ä¢ Stream operations can be performed either sequentially or parallel. 

       names.parallelStream(); // creates a parallel stream

How Stream API Works ‚ùì  
----------------------

‚û°Ô∏èStream API : map()
---------------------

‚Ä¢ map : Convert(transform) one type to another.

‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt get confused this with Map Collection. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edcd1d74-f782-42cc-ac32-932d2d123f9e)

‚û°Ô∏èStream API : flatMap()
-------------------------

‚Ä¢ flatMap : Converts(Transforms) one type to another as like map() method.

‚Ä¢ Used in the context of Stream where each element in the stream represents multiple elements.

Example:

‚Ä¢ Each Stream element represents multiple elements.

     ‚Ä¢ Stream<List>
     ‚Ä¢ Steam<Arrays>

‚û°Ô∏èStream API ‚Äì distinct() , count() and sorted()
------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ distinct ‚Äì Returns a stream with unique elements.

‚Ä¢ count ‚Äì Returns a long with the total no of elements in the Stream.

‚Ä¢ sorted - Sort the elements in the stream.

‚û°Ô∏èStream API ‚Äì filter()
-------------------------

‚Ä¢ filter ‚Äì filters the elements in the stream.

Input to the filter is a Predicate Functional Interface.

‚û°Ô∏èStreams API - reduce()
------------------------

‚Ä¢ reduce ‚Äì This is a terminal operation. Used to reduce the contents of a stream to a single value.

‚Ä¢ It takes two parameters as an input.

     ‚Ä¢ First parameters ‚Äì default or initial value
     ‚Ä¢ Second Parameter ‚Äì BinaryOperator<T>

‚û°Ô∏èStream API : Max/Min using reduce()
--------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ max -> Maximum(largest) element in the stream.

‚Ä¢ min -> Minimum(smallest) element in the stream.

‚û°Ô∏èStream API : limit() and skip() 
----------------------------------

‚Ä¢ These two function helps to create a sub-stream.

‚Ä¢ limit(n) ‚Äì limits the ‚Äún‚Äù numbers of elements to be processed in the stream.

‚Ä¢ skip(n) ‚Äì skips the ‚Äún‚Äù number of elements from the stream.

‚û°Ô∏èStreams API : anyMatch(), allMatch(), noneMatch()
---------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ All these functions takes in a predicate as an input and returns a Boolean as an output.

‚Ä¢ anyMatch()- Returns true if any one of the element matches the predicate, otherwise false.

‚Ä¢ allMatch() - Returns true if all the element in the stream matches the predicate, otherwise false.

‚Ä¢ noneMatch() ‚Äì Just opposite to allMatch(). Returns true if none of the element in the stream matches the predicate, otherwise false.

‚û°Ô∏èStreams API : findFirst() and findAny()
-----------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ Used to find an element in the stream.

‚Ä¢ Both the functions returns the result of type Optional.

‚Ä¢ findFirst() ‚Äì Returns first element in the stream.

‚Ä¢ findAny() ‚Äì Returns the first encountered element in the stream.
