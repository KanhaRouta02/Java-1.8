About the Course
================

✅ Why Java 8 ?
----------------

• Most popular and widely accepted language in the world.

• Java creators wanted to introduce the Functional features such

as:

• Lambdas

• Streams

• Optional and etc.,

• Technological advancements with the mobile/laptops/systems.

• New Java 8 features simplify the concurrency operations.

Functional Programming: ❓
-------------------------
• Embraces creating Immutable objects.

• More concise and readable code.

• Using functions/methods as first class citizens.

Example:

Function<String,String> addSomeString = (name) ->

name.toUpperCase().concat("default");

• Write code using Declarative approach.

Imperative vs Declarative Programming
=====================================

Imperative Style of Programming
-------------------------------

• Focuses on how to perform the operations.

• Embraces Object mutability.

• This style of programming lists the step by step of instructions on how

to achieve an objective.

• We write the code on what needs to be done in each step.

• Imperative style is used with classic Object Oriented Programming.

Declarative Style of Programming
--------------------------------

• Focuses on what is the result you want.

• Embraces Object immutability.

• Analogous to SQL (Structured Query Languague).

• Use the functions that are already part of the library to achieve an

objective.

• Functional Programming uses the concept of declarative programming.

Imperative vs Declarative Programming
--------------------------------------

                                 Example 1
                     Sum of 100 numbers from 0 to 100

Imperative vs Declarative Programming
-------------------------------------

                               Example 2
                     Removing duplicates from a list of integers
