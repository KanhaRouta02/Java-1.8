About the Course üìö
================

‚úÖ Why Java 8 ?
----------------

‚Ä¢ Most popular and widely accepted language in the world.

‚Ä¢ Java creators wanted to introduce the Functional features such as:

     ‚Ä¢ Lambdas

     ‚Ä¢ Streams

     ‚Ä¢ Optional and etc.,

‚Ä¢ Technological advancements with the mobile/laptops/systems.

‚Ä¢ New Java 8 features simplify the concurrency operations.

‚úÖFunctional Programming: ‚ùì
-------------------------
‚Ä¢ Embraces creating Immutable objects.

‚Ä¢ More concise and readable code.

‚Ä¢ Using functions/methods as first class citizens.

Example:

     Function<String,String> addSomeString = (name) -> name.toUpperCase().concat("default");

‚Ä¢ Write code using Declarative approach.

 ‚úÖImperative vs Declarative Programming
  =====================================

üëâImperative Style of Programming
-------------------------------

‚Ä¢ Focuses on how to perform the operations.

‚Ä¢ Embraces Object mutability.

‚Ä¢ This style of programming lists the step by step of instructions on how to achieve an objective.

‚Ä¢ We write the code on what needs to be done in each step.

‚Ä¢ Imperative style is used with classic Object Oriented Programming.

üëâDeclarative Style of Programming
--------------------------------

‚Ä¢ Focuses on what is the result you want.

‚Ä¢ Embraces Object immutability.

‚Ä¢ Analogous to SQL (Structured Query Languague).

‚Ä¢ Use the functions that are already part of the library to achieve an objective.

‚Ä¢ Functional Programming uses the concept of declarative programming.

‚û°Ô∏èImperative vs Declarative Programming
--------------------------------------

                                 Example 1
                     Sum of 100 numbers from 0 to 100

                      /* Imperative Style of Programming - How style of programming */
                       int sum = 0;
                       for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
                       sum += i;
                       }
                       System.out.println("Imperative Style of Programming : " + sum); // 5050

                       /* Declarative Style of Programming - What style of programming */
                       int sum1 = IntStream.rangeClosed(0, 100)
                       .sum();
                       System.out.println("Declarative Style of Programming : " + sum1); //5050

What is Lambda Expression‚ùì
-------------------------

‚Ä¢ Lambda is equivalent to a function (method) without a name.

‚Ä¢ Lambda‚Äôs are also referred as Anonymous functions.

          ‚Ä¢ Method parameters
          ‚Ä¢ Method Body
          ‚Ä¢ Return Type
‚Ä¢ Lambdas are not tied to any class like a regular method.

‚Ä¢ Lambda can also be assigned to variable and passed around.

‚û°Ô∏èSyntax of the Lambda Expression
-------------------------------

  Lambda Expression:

 ‚úÖUsages of Lambda
 ------------------

 ‚Ä¢ Lambda is mainly used to implement Functional Interfaces(SAM).
 
               @FunctionalInterface
               public interface Comparator<T> {
                int compare(T o1, T o2);
               }
               @FunctionalInterface
               public interface Runnable {
                public abstract void run();
               }

‚úÖLambda in Practice ( Things to keep in Mind)
-------------------------------------------

( ) -> Single Statement or Expression; // curly braces are not needed.

( )-> { <Multiple Statements> }; // curly braces are needed for multiple statements.

‚û°Ô∏èLambdas vs Legacy Java(until Java7)
-----------------------------------

Legacy:

     Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
      @Override
      public void run() {
      System.out.println("Inside Runnable 1");
      }
     };

Java 8:

     Runnable runnableLambda = () -> {System.out.println("Inside Runnable
     2");};     

‚úÖFunctional Interfaces
------------------------

‚Ä¢ Exists since Java 1.0 

Definition:

‚Ä¢ A Functional Interface(SAM) is an interface that has exactly one abstract
method. 

@FunctionalInterface:

‚Ä¢ This annotation is introduced as part of the JDK 1.8.

‚Ä¢ Optional annotation to signify an interface as Functional Interface.

‚úÖNew Functional Interfaces in Java8
------------------------------------

     ‚Ä¢ Consumer
     ‚Ä¢ Predicate
     ‚Ä¢ Function
     ‚Ä¢ Supplier
     ‚Ä¢ Consumer ‚Äì BiConsumer
     ‚Ä¢ Predicate - BiPredicate
     ‚Ä¢ Function ‚Äì BiFunction, UnaryOperator, BinaryOperator
     ‚Ä¢ Consumer ‚Äì IntConsumer, DoubleConsumer, LongConsumer
     ‚Ä¢ Predicate ‚Äì IntPredicate, BiPredicate, LongPredicate
     ‚Ä¢ Function ‚Äì IntFunction, DoubleFunction, LongFunction,IntToDoubleFunction,
                  IntoLongFunction,DoubletoIntFunction,
                  DoubletoLongFunction,LongtoIntFunction,
                  LongtoDoubleFunction,ToIntFunction,
                  ToDoubleFunction,ToLongFunction
     ‚Ä¢ Supplier ‚Äì IntSupplier, LongSupplier, DoubleSupplier, BooleanSupplier
     
‚úÖMethod Reference
--------------------

‚Ä¢ Introduced as part of Java 8 and its purpose is to simplify the implementation Functional Interfaces.

‚Ä¢ Shortcut for writing the Lambda Expressions.

‚Ä¢ Refer a method in a class.

‚û°Ô∏èSyntax of Method Reference
-----------------------------

      ClassName::instance-methodName
      ClassName::static-methodName
      Instance::methodName

 Where to use Method Reference ‚ùì
 -------------------------------

 ‚Ä¢ Lambda expressions referring to a method directly.
   
   Using Lambda: 
   
       Function<String,String> toUpperCaseLambda = (s)->s.toUpperCase(); 

   Using Method Reference:

      Function<String,String> toUpperCaseMethodRefernce = String::toUpperCase;
    
 Where Method Reference is not Applicable ‚ùì 
 ------------------------------------------

 Example: 

     Predicate<Student> predicateUsingLambda = (s) -> s.getGradeLevel()>=3;

‚úÖConstructor Reference  
-----------------------

‚Ä¢ Introduced as part of Java 1.8

Syntax:

    Classname::new

Example: 

    Supplier<Student> studentSupplier = Student::new; 

Invalid: 

    Student student = Student::new; // compilation issue
